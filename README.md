# Wedding Social Posts

A solution that displays all Twitter and Instagram posts with a particular hastag on a single page, sorted by timestamp. I found two solutions by others on Github (thanks in .js comments), worked to understand their JavaScript code and then adapted it and added to it to create the solution I wanted. There was a good amount of problem solving and proved to be a great opportunity to enhance my debugging skillset using things like Chrome's devtools.
